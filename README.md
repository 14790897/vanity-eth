## Usage

First of all, visit [`git.io/veth`](https://git.io/veth)

Enter the prefix of your choice, then click 'generate' to start.

You browser is going to generate a ton of random addresses until one of them starts with your prefix.

Ethereum addresses are hexadecimal, which means your prefix can only contain numbers and letters from A to F.

 You can increase the number of working threads to reach higher speeds, or decrease it if you computer struggles.

## Security

As explained above, everything is computed in your browser. Nothing ever leaves your machine, or even your browser tab.

You can download the latest build of Vantiy-ETH from Github and use it completely offline.

Vanity-ETH uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate Ethereum addresses.


## Performance

For some reason, the performance of Vanity-ETH can vary a lot from a browser to another.
 
Right now, Chrome seems to be the one providing the best results.


## Offline usage

Vanity-ETH works perfectly offline! Once the web page is loaded, you can turn off the internet and continue playing.
